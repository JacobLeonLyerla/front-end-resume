# Portfolio
  I wanted to build something that showed me, I tried to not reference other people and other portfolios.
  I wanted something unique, my favorite thing about my resume is the gif play button.
  It was really fun to figure out how to get it to work, and I really like what I came up with.
  Ask me about it, I am a very passionate programmer and I am totally open to talking about my code.
  I am always looking to improve and grow.
